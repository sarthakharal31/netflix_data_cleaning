# 📊 Netflix Data Cleaning Project

This is a small project where I worked on cleaning and preparing a Netflix dataset using Python and Pandas. 
The goal was to transform raw data into a clean and structured format that’s ready for analysis.

## 🧠 Objective
The main aim was to practice and apply real-world data cleaning techniques, including:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Fixing inconsistent or incorrect data types
- Exporting the cleaned data to Excel for easy sharing or visualization

## 📁 Files Included
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `netflix_titles.csv` | The original, uncleaned dataset |
| `Netflix__dataa_cleaning.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook with the entire cleaning process |
| `Netflix_cleaned.xlsx` | Final cleaned dataset saved as an Excel file |
